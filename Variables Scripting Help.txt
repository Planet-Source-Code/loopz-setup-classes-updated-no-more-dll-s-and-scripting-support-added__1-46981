I introduced a little use of variables into the scripting language supported.
	
	It just gives you the ability to get an input and save it to a variable that will be used later.

Variables are saved in this format : VARNAME==VARVALUE

You can call a variable by using var[varaiblename] into a string.
You can get an input by writing GetInput Your Name__Hi!!__variable1
Then you can display it with MsgBox Your Name is var[variable1]!__Hi!!__Info
